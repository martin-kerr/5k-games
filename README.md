# 5k-games
Code for tracking progress on challenges associated with your free, weekly timed, 5k in the park!


## Alphabet Bingo (alphabet-bingo.py)
Find out how many letters of the alphabet you've collected from the fist letter of each of the 'free, weekly, timed 5k in the park' events you have attended and which letters you still need to collect.

Simply copy the 'All Results' table (data only, no column headers) from your 'free, weekly, timed 5k in the park' profile page and the program will read the clipboard when run and then output the list of events you've attended as well as the letters collected and needed.

## Round the Clock Bingo (round-the-clock-bingo.py)
Looks at all finish times and ignores 'minutes' to output how many unique 'seconds' have been completed. Again input is the 'All Results' table (data only, no column headers) copied to clipboard
